# gd-abstract
An attempt to create an abstraction and visualization of the entire GD process

# Goals
* Visualise the entire GD process so use during discussion.
* Generalise the structure enough that a majority of projects can be described in this way.
* Test Github as a communication platform for creating non-code projects.
* Create a visual tool for showing this process.
* Eventually simplify this structure to be suitable for children.

# Existing Formal GD structures and techniques
* [Mechanics, Dynamics, Abstract](http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~rob/publications/MDA.pdf)
* [Dotsenko Approach](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/AndrewDotsenko/20160304/267298/Game_Design_Framework_On_the_way_to_good_Game_Design.php)
* [Low Level Design](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-I08qX76DgSFyN1ByIGtPuqXh7bVKraHcNIA25tpAzE/edit)
* [High Level Design](http://www.csc.kth.se/utbildning/kth/kurser/DH2640/grip08/HighConceptTemplate-Inl4.pdf)
* [Top Down or Bottom up?](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2129/game_design_cognition_the_.php?print=1)
* [MTDA+N Model](http://www.firstpersonscholar.com/a-working-theory-of-game-design/)

# How to contribute
I have had some success with using gitlab projects as a base for planning and communication. I would like to follow the "Everything starts with an issue" approach. Everyone should feel free to comment on discussion issues. From these discussions we can create To-Dos and then the actual content would be added to the wiki/repo.
